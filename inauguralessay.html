Light snow drifts gently down from low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts about my <i>Dark Muse</i><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.8787578' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.8787578' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<i>muse</i>: Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts, <i>or</i> a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a <i>muse</i> over a poem, <i>or</i> a
source of inspiration, e.g., <i>She is my muse</i>.

Do you have an affinity for things on the gloomy side?  Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary &#x2026; like when an overcast day brings on a
strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy night is frightening in
a wonderfully thrilling sort of way? Does twilight free your senses
<i>and</i> deepen your thoughts? Perhaps you&rsquo;ve paused to gaze transfixed
upon an old, abandoned cemetery, or a lonely, nondescript
landscape. And of course you&rsquo;re quickly maxed out on happy-clappy,
sunny-cheery. You prefer candlelight over artificial light, old
architecture over new, the genial disorder of wild nature over
predictably orderly gardens. The spectacular is ho-hum, but the subtle
and hidden are magnetic. And wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if every month (or
week!) we celebrated Halloween? If yes to any of this, you might
understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say here.

The first elephant I must immediately escort out of the room is the
modern <i>goth subculture</i><label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.6170977' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.6170977' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">here</a> as well as anywhere. In very short, I believe
they, like many, can <i>sense</i> dark, but for whatever reasons only want
to express it, explore it very narrowly through goth music and
fashion. Lots more about why goth seems to skip the Dark Muse later&#x2026;
</span>, as well as all the sensationalist
<i>gothic</i> horror fright memes&#x2014;vampires, witches, demons, nasty mean
this, campy evil that. Yes, my Dark Muse would hopefully include, be a
superset of what today is called goth and gothic, but I hope to go
deeper and more elemental than most modern takes I&rsquo;ve seen on
dark. Right up front: My version of dark is not meant to shock or
frighten. My Dark Muse contains nothing cruel nor evil nor sinister
nor satanic<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.9509169' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.9509169' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
As philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in
describing the modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, &ldquo;Horror is the
<i>aesthetic</i> of when you feel like you&rsquo;re losing your grip on reality.&rdquo;
Nothing to gain with horror memes. Not going there&#x2026;
</span>. Not the <i>Star Wars</i> &ldquo;dark side,&rdquo; not the barbarism
à la <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, and not the psychic dark described by Freud
or Jung. I&rsquo;m after something more subtle, discriminating, and
inward-personal. I hearken back to a golden era when dark was the
currency, namely, the early nineteenth century, a time when key poets
(e.g. the Brontës) showed us how triste and Stygian can lead to
subtlety and sublimity<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.997394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.997394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Indeed, <i>sublimity</i>. More on Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as
Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t get it at all&rdquo; tedium on
<i>sublimity</i> later. In short, <i>sublime</i> is what we may find beyond mere
beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying here: <i>There are seconds,
they only come five or six at a time, and you suddenly feel the
<b>presence of eternal harmony</b> fully achieved. It is nothing earthly;
not that it is heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his earthly
state. One must change physically or die. The feeling is clear and
indisputable. As if you suddenly sense the whole of nature and
suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not tenderheartedness, but
simply joy.</i> &#x2026; Perhaps awe instead of joy? Again, much more as we go
along&#x2026;
</span>. I&rsquo;m talking about a dark that one
doesn&rsquo;t outgrow, rather, that sustains. There should be no &ldquo;aging out
of the scene,&rdquo; rather, a continued deepening and widening for one&rsquo;s
entire life.

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society&#x2014;virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my sort of past-century British-feeling
English. Why?  Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth
century was like a thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful and
capable of amazingly deep and expressive things; whilst modern
American street English is beggared, destitute, impoverished and
requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there&#x2014;although I&rsquo;m sure I will occasionally slip up. Back in the day
people were more genteel, thoughtful, fine-spoken. They could express
themselves with utter sublimity. They understood the human need for
holiness, grandeur, the eternal. Compare this with the modernists we
see everywhere today who believe being coarse, crass, base, and
irreverent is somehow progress&#x2026; But on the other hand, it might just
be that I&rsquo;ve finally succumbed to the influence of all those
schoolmarms back in my distant childhood who had us read Romantic Era
lit, holding up that &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; other-century English as superior. They
were right, you know. And yes, I&rsquo;ll drop foreign as well as Latin
words and phrases, my foreign language being German&#x2026; You&rsquo;ve been
warned.

<p>
A quick litmus test. I present here a short, simple poem from my main
darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the centre of
everything I mean to say about dark&#x2014;Emily Jane Brontë! <label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.9464806' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.9464806' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, discovering new
things, gleaning deeper insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick
biography.  <br>
<img src="images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg" alt="Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Direct, blunt even. But there it is: Either she speaks to something in
you, or you&rsquo;re part of the majority who finds it&#x2014;weird,
abnormal, morbid, overwrought, even sick or evil. To be sure, my dark
<i>penchant</i> gets mostly deer-in-headlights responses, if not outright
hostility. The openly hostile see my dark druthers as morose, morbid,
as &ldquo;wallowing in self-pity&rdquo; or &ldquo;dwelling on the negative.&rdquo; I beg to
differ&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
<i>Christina Rossetti</i> <label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.6835166' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.6835166' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti">here</a> for a bio. She is considered by many Britain&rsquo;s
most prolific poet. <br>
<img src="images/RossettiAge16.jpg" alt="RossettiAge16.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fade tender lily,<br>
Fade O crimson rose,<br>
Fade every flower<br>
Sweetest flower that blows.<br>
<br>
Go chilly Autumn,<br>
Come O Winter cold;<br>
Let the green things die away<br>
Into common mould.<br>
<br>
Birth follows hard on death,<br>
Life on withering:<br>
Hasten, we shall come the sooner<br>
Back to pleasant Spring.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
These two poems are not being glum or morose. Rossetti would carefully
exposit a dark fatalism, ending with hope bound in humility. I like to
think they are expressing an informed, matured melancholy that
bespeaks a deeper understanding of life.
</p>

<p>
And another poem<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.7509643' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.7509643' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
As I&rsquo;ve found, the Dark Muse finds its best, most concentrated
expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry delivers the
ineffable of darkness later.
</span>, here Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a
collection published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>
Over the woodlands brown and bare,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Over the harvest-fields forsaken,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>

<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>

Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow">here</a> for a quick biography. HWL was not typically dark,
rather, a popular &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; poet with a big audience. That&rsquo;s what
makes this selection so unique for me.
</span> looking to the natural world and
<i>poetising</i><label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.9582425' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.9582425' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
The idea of poetising, the <i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives, and in olden times nature was the stage.
</span>, to be sure, <i>darkly</i>. As a result agents of mental
affliction and depression&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;are transformed
into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy resulting in a
higher emotional maturity. In some paradoxical way, nature and
darkness as witnesses will eventually become healers. As if the
initial agony and sorrow are a ravaging cancer or virus that
eventually fades into remission, but can never entirely be eliminated
while on Earth.
</p>

<p>
This <i>poetising</i> of nature as darker and more mystical was the modus
operandi of my select nineteenth-century poets<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.3755456' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.3755456' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Dark as a teacher. Novalis, who we&rsquo;ll meet later,
described in exceptionally moving poetic terms the night as a soother
and healer.
</span>. Rather than
avoid, they <i>embraced the dark</i>, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world might consider counter-intuitive, if
not wrong-headed. I contend we&rsquo;ve lost this subtle art of moving
hardship, tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission
melancholy, of finding a <i>modus vivendi</i><label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.191658' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.191658' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> with the trials and
tribulations of life as our ancestors once did.
</p>

<p>
Surely we suffer poorly. All we may ever do is usher the initially
searing, inescapable pain to a dull ache in the backdrop of
time. Though I would say this was better understood in the past than
today. They did not attempt to contain, disguise, or <i>process</i> greif,
rather, greif was faced directly, pain was shared. Emotional space was
allotted, support communal, organic, and natural. Strikingly different
from today was their acceptance of doom and fate, two concepts
antithetical to our dynamic, positivist, self-determining,
fix-everthing-quickly modern attitudes.
</p>

<p>
Consider Queen Victoria<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.3920329' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.3920329' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. <br>
<img src="images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg" alt="QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today&rsquo;s all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused,
disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns show towards
death<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.2063828' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.2063828' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Is there anything worse than the so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">five stages of
grief</a></i> or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.
</span>. For the early nineteenth century, poetising life&rsquo;s train
of tragedy was depression deconstruction as a life skill. The slings
and arrows of human existence found conjunction with <i>nature</i>,
<i>darkness</i>, and <i>faith</i> through poetry, thereby highlighting,
elevating our uniquely human experience on Earth, casting a gossamer
of sublimity over our natural existence like no other generation
before or since. Theirs was the deepest exploration of our true
humanness that I know and, thus, something I must pursue.

Allow me German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.
</span>? Dark speaks to me, but, again, why? Lack
of a clear and simple answer begs a wordier one. Dark remains
mysterious&#x2014;no matter how I try to imbibe or express it. Dark is
something instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is
more than the lack of light. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in the
secretive shadows of the forest appeals more than the spectacular
sunny vista across the forest valley. The fresh-cut rose elicits one
response, but the faded rose another&#x2014;deeper but for me never
dysphoric.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial beauty and fragrance. Once
affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent thereafter. Beauty
always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover its eclipse,
joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our march to the
grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I still search
my night shore; for until now I have known only of beauty’s haunting
rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest quickenings of things
necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes, in this moment I may
have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will cherish with a larger,
more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo sent down life’s long,
clouded memory hall as the true and lasting blessing.

<p>
Yes, there might have been a dinner invite for me back in the day.

Let&rsquo;s see another example of get-it-or-don&rsquo;t, this time a poem from
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.6088083' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.6088083' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>

In the third line, <i>Heft</i> means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; <i>or</i> (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
There&rsquo;s a certain Slant of light,<br>
Winter Afternoons —<br>

Shadows – hold their breath —<br>

<p>
Indeed. That last line includes <i>Death</i> capitalised<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.5593498' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.5593498' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising of nouns for
poetic emphasis.
</span>. Now I must
emphasise these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. Unfortunately, this capitalised,
past-century view of Death has become opaque, lost. I hope to
rediscover it. I&rsquo;ll start by stating their understanding of Death was
integral to their understanding of nature&#x2026;

My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. Just
considering our indoor living environments today, a typical modern
building is more like a sealed <i>space station</i> plopped down on a
hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive
structures of the not-so-distant past. Quite literally, the Brontës&rsquo;
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from one, <i>two</i> thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.538334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.538334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>

</span>. Hence, <i>in just the past two to three hundred
years a very steep, vertical gradient or differential has grown
between indoors and outdoors</i>. This, in turn, has brought us to see
nature more as a <i>place</i> separate and outside, cut off, away of our

Is it not ironic how nearly every lifeform that attempts to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?
</span> &#x2026; which, in turn, has lead us to rate <i>outdoors
nature</i> on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our
sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only environments.

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>

</p>

<p>
As late as my own childhood I remember hearing the term <i>homespun</i> to
refer to a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person&rsquo;s clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The Brontëan
early-nineteenth century of Yorkshire would have had a majority of the
villagers wearing homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.8292509' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.8292509' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
Cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both cotton
and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered factories
as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.
</span>. And of course food was entirely local. Meaning a
person&rsquo;s daily resources were majority local, a small bit coming from
a nearby <i>market town</i>, while only the most exotic items (e.g., a
clock) would have come from farther away. Today, however, this supply
pyramid is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from far
(far!)  away (e.g. China) while only a few personal items would be
from a local or even regional source<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.4014702' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.4014702' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.
</span>. And so in Brontëan times
the surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a working
partner. Contrast this with today&rsquo;s urban-suburban populations hardly
ever in contact with farmers or their farms. And we rarely know where
our clothing came from. Nature as &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; as our immediate
provider, has been completely abstracted into concepts such as
<i>ecosystems</i>, which implies the human is a removed observer
controlling nature as if it were a machine.
</p>

<p>
Surely humans have always made a distinction between being inside a
shelter and going outside into the so-called <i>elements</i>. But starting
some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up aboriginal
nomadic life with its direct daily contact with said elements to
establish permanent city-states supported by land-domineering
monoculture agriculture. And so indoor environments in ever-expanding
urban centres, evermore physically removed, walled off from the wild
natural world, became increasingly self-contained, all-encompassing,
self-referencing, recursively derivative<label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.5048928' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.5048928' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and <i>extra-natural</i> <label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.7492692' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.7492692' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?&#x2026;
</span>. Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.4328065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.4328065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span>. Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.9741297' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.9741297' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more abstracted
<i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How then can we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.8686861' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.8686861' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent (beneficial)
alteration, or B) a temporary adjustment, allowance for
less-that-optimal conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal
conditions. We humans, I contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are
certainly no barometer species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our own
well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.
</span>, objectively measure our
separation from nature?  What has domestic, urban, indoor living done
to our brains, our sense of belonging to the planet, to one another?
How can we even begin to trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations,
the chain of derivatives we&rsquo;ve taken for all these centuries down,
out, and away from <i>nature pure</i>?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a
collective will to make conditions better for us and us alone. We see
our dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate,
as destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty
years to eight billion<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.799649' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.799649' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and <i>260%</i>
between 1900 and 2000.
</span> says something to our intention and
ability to dominate. And we seemed to have adapted our collective
human psyche, our narratives to this separation<label id='fnr.30' for='fnr-in.30.364152' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.30.364152' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup>
Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span>. <i>But is this
sustainable?</i> All dark musings aside, some of us have become concerned
over the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature<label id='fnr.31' for='fnr-in.31.2866338' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.31.2866338' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span>. Let me suggest a different
understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death going on everywhere.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, sensed
this pre-modern meaning of nature as <i>sans localisation</i> inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s
touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i> <label id='fnr.32' for='fnr-in.32.8608479' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.32.8608479' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup>
Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban
production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any
sort of nature, spatial or otherwise. Indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic
mills.&rdquo;  This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. Even when the individual left his house he was still deep
within a massive concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive
activity.
</span>. Here again is Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The
night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, she refers to the outdoors. She even refers to the wilds as
&ldquo;wastes&rdquo;<label id='fnr.33' for='fnr-in.33.8320514' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.33.8320514' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup>
In those days wilds were often referred to as wastelands.
</span> and as drear. And yet she is transfixed, frozen to the
spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, she says. Subjective terms like wastes
and drear remind of the age-old attitude of nature as a terrible,
grim, inescapable master, a sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which
to wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly
into an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in
so doing she sensed something deep and found sublimity evoked,
then she brought to us in her lines of poetry a new way of being more
human<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.8227159' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.8227159' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
Contrast this inescapable nature back then with Hemingway&rsquo;s
nature. Sure, he went to relatively remote places to play the macho
man. But if anything serious happened he could always be airlifted
out. The Romantic Era poets&#x2014;supposedly effete and sappy&#x2014; were in
nature always with no timeout, no escape.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic modern take of just
terminal, physical breakage and malfunction<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.5581964' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.5581964' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
Couple this death as malfunction with atheism for a completely
soulless mechanistic universe realism dumpster fire.&ldquo;
</span>. Especially death
become Death, a quasi-spiritual <i>force majeure</i>. But today
deterioration and death aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. It&rsquo;s almost as if
they were cordoned off&#x2014;at least under much greater human control
than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern medicine we have begun to
acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto power over physical
demise.</i> And with this control we have torn down, dismantled a great
component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of one&rsquo;s mortality
with a deity. Where once was supposed a mortal, physical plane below
an immortal, spiritual plane, we now would look only to the physical
plane as exclusive. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has from old age, fatal accident, or from deadly
physical aggression or predation<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.5018104' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.5018104' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
unstoppable. And so we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the mystery of Death,
overturn fate and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.2944340' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.2944340' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this goth version</a> of the classic rock song. Had this
been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no cheap,
sentimental gimmick.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
What then if we start to take command of death&rsquo;s agenda, rerouting
death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by no
means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life, and even if
we get them they might not be that great. And yet we have grown to
<i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of modern medical science a
healthy, quality seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years. And so
modern medicine has disrupted the two last components of nature
ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration and death. Modern science has
lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom
by redefining life as the circuitry of organic machinery, a mechanism
that, in turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained,
improved against entropic wear-and-tear<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.5152706' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.5152706' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>
Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally commands the human heart with electronic pulses.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.3437371' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.3437371' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions &#x2014; including their probabilities of success or failure
&#x2014; a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could, <i>should</i> be
beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the modern medical
labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has all but become an
expectation of, a guaranteed minimum&#x2014;even to the extent that old age
and death are increasingly spoken of as &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should
defeat. Death a nuisance. My father felt cheated when that three-,
fourscore and more was not forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I
contend life is life only with death&#x2014;death absolute and not
theorised away. God must be somewhere in all this.

Simply put, HTTN is the densest, purest testament to the Dark Muse
ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from was
grief-stricken after the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie
von Kühn. Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck described the teenage Sopie as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2013;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2013;we must call superearthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
For the bats maybe, but for nature as a whole?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their surrounding environment<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.7952004' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.7952004' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span>. And yet what happens
when a species keeps thriving more and more, increasing its success
statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that
real integration and harmony with nature would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t
we humans Exhibit A of just such an out-of-control species?</b> And so I
ask, how can this be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours, which seems to be always &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price? Simply put, How
can more and more people consuming more and more resources and energy,
each of us fantasising about reaching top-dog success and prosperity,
not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind Emily Brontë was a sort of hard-pressed little bat out in
the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out a
marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king—though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond. Again, I must believe she
was a little bat driven across the semi-wilderness moorland, as true
an existential <i>underdog</i> as was still possible back
then<label id='fnr.50' for='fnr-in.50.6044953' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.50.6044953' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup>
Compare with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer with technical gear
from REI, Patagonia, North Face, driving to government set-aside wilds
in a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consuming protein bars and
electrolyte drinks, listening to music with earbuds, taking smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on a satellite connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re
just amateur Earth astronauts, no?
</span>. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition,
contaminated water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or all
three&#x2014;five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months<label id='fnr.51' for='fnr-in.51.9824959' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>51</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.51.9824959' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>51</sup>
A stay in Belgium to learn French and a gig in nearby Halifax
as a governess.
</span>. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
Still, one might still ask if her existence in the early nineteen
century was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not
observing nature from civilization&rsquo;s relative place of safety, thereby
rendering her observations just as relative as ours today? I say
no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, as we of the
twenty-first century float above in unprecedented levels of modern
high-tech materialism<label id='fnr.52' for='fnr-in.52.4244958' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.52.4244958' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup>
We consume one hundred times the resources and energy per
capita as one of our European ancestors from 1800.
</span>. But I contend hers was a unique
observation vantage point, neither to exposed nor removed from
elemental nature.
</p>

<p>
When modern scoffers think of how the Romantic Era poets perceived and
reported nature, we might think of picnics where dandies and their
pampered ladies are attended by servants at garden-like country
estates like from the Hollywood film version of Jane Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i>
</p>

<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>

<p>
or playful romps like Hollywood&rsquo;s latest anachronistic redo of Emily
Brontë depicting her rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated
country setting
</p>

<img src="./images/TumblingEmily1.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap">Fictional E.B. in a silly, carefree moment tumbling down a hill</b><br>(From the 2022 film <b>Emily</b>) </span>

<p>
For modern tastes nature is nothing as seemingly tame as Hollywood&rsquo;s
England back then. Again, for us nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> far
away from our modern interior spaces. Nature is the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>. Again, the farther afield from modern civilization we can
go, the truer and more authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so a
<i>nature continuum</i> whereby a trackless wilderness as far from
civilization as possible is the truest nature, while the least nature
would be, e.g., a ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our
forced-air-HVAC, triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad suburban
houses. Nature can only be very wild, thus, very far away from the
safety of civilization. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London
exploit this fright memes of nature as a distant, hostile place. Which
is virtually identical to science fiction stories of hostile alien
planets &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; by brave, intrepid astronauts. To be sure, many
sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are simply off-Earth versions of
London&rsquo;s Klondike Yukon.

<p>
After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0315c5e">
<p>
One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski&rsquo;s <i>presence of eternal
harmoy</i> came to me on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy
in a small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our
street, the oldest neighborhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone,
and gas streetlights. At some point I felt like I had left the present
and entered another dimension, a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as a child not yet disabused of
magic, I didn&rsquo;t think anything was too out of the ordinary. I
distinctly remember looking up into the dense, bare branches of a huge
old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out of crossing clouds and
feeling like I was a spirit entered another world. Tonight, I can see
this other world of shadow and magic as I look out at my
waning-moonlit <i>Inland Sea</i> over the treetops of dark spruce and
gnarled, bare aspen.
</p>

<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world&rsquo;s largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Though I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to <i>her</i> being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.53' for='fnr-in.53.9906550' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>53</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.53.9906550' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>53</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the summer.
</span>. <i>She</i> has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.
</p>

<p>
A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>.
</p>

<p>
Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.
